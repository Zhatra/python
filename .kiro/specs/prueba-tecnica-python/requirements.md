# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive technical test solution that demonstrates data processing capabilities and API development skills. The solution consists of two main components: a complete data processing pipeline for transaction data from two fictional companies, and a REST API application that solves the missing number problem from a set of the first 100 natural numbers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Loading and Storage

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to load transaction data from CSV files into a database, so that I can process and analyze the information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a CSV file with transaction data THEN it SHALL load the data into a chosen database system
2. WHEN selecting a database system THEN the system SHALL use either MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB
3. WHEN implementing the data loading process THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation explaining the database choice rationale
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL handle data validation and error cases gracefully
5. WHEN the loading process completes THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful data import

### Requirement 2: Data Extraction

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to extract information from the database using a programming language, so that I can process the data for further analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting data from the database THEN the system SHALL use a suitable programming language (Python, Java, etc.)
2. WHEN extracting data THEN the system SHALL export the information in CSV, Avro, or Parquet format
3. WHEN implementing the extraction process THEN the system SHALL include documentation explaining the language and format choices
4. WHEN extraction encounters issues THEN the system SHALL document any challenges faced and solutions implemented
5. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and completeness

### Requirement 3: Data Transformation

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to transform the extracted data to match a specific schema, so that it conforms to business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transforming data THEN the system SHALL convert it to match the specified schema:
   - id varchar(24) NOT NULL
   - company_name varchar(130) NULL
   - company_id varchar(24) NOT NULL
   - amount decimal(16,2) NOT NULL
   - status varchar(30) NOT NULL
   - created_at timestamp NOT NULL
   - updated_at timestamp NULL
2. WHEN performing transformations THEN the system SHALL handle data type conversions appropriately
3. WHEN transformation encounters data quality issues THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data cleaning strategies
4. WHEN implementing transformations THEN the system SHALL document all transformation logic and challenges encountered
5. WHEN transformation completes THEN the system SHALL validate that all data conforms to the target schema

### Requirement 4: Data Distribution and Normalization

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to create a normalized database structure with separate tables for charges and companies, so that data is properly organized and related.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the database structure THEN the system SHALL create a 'charges' table for transaction information
2. WHEN creating the database structure THEN the system SHALL create a 'companies' table for company information
3. WHEN designing the schema THEN the system SHALL establish proper relationships between charges and companies tables
4. WHEN loading transformed data THEN the system SHALL populate both tables with appropriate data distribution
5. WHEN the database design is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a database diagram showing table relationships
6. WHEN querying the data THEN the system SHALL ensure referential integrity between related tables

### Requirement 5: SQL Reporting View

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to view total transaction amounts by day for different companies, so that I can analyze daily transaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating reporting capabilities THEN the system SHALL implement a database view
2. WHEN the view is queried THEN it SHALL show total transaction amounts grouped by day
3. WHEN the view is queried THEN it SHALL show data separated by company
4. WHEN implementing the view THEN it SHALL handle date formatting and aggregation correctly
5. WHEN the view is created THEN it SHALL be optimized for query performance

### Requirement 6: Missing Number API Application

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an API that can find a missing number from the first 100 natural numbers, so that I can demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN it SHALL be written in Python (as per profile requirements)
2. WHEN creating the core functionality THEN the system SHALL implement a class representing the set of first 100 natural numbers
3. WHEN the class is implemented THEN it SHALL have an Extract method to remove a specific number
4. WHEN the class is implemented THEN it SHALL have a method to calculate and return which number was extracted
5. WHEN processing input THEN the system SHALL validate that inputs are numbers and less than 100
6. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL accept user arguments and demonstrate the missing number calculation
7. WHEN the application executes THEN it SHALL show that it correctly identified the extracted number

### Requirement 7: Development Environment and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive installation and execution procedures, so that the solution can be easily deployed and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivering the solution THEN it SHALL include complete installation procedures for all tools and dependencies
2. WHEN providing deployment options THEN the system SHALL support Docker containerization
3. WHEN implementing the solution THEN it SHALL include unit tests or integration tests
4. WHEN documenting the solution THEN it SHALL include execution scripts for all procedures
5. WHEN sharing the solution THEN it SHALL be available via GitHub repository or ZIP file
6. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL demonstrate that all components work correctly
